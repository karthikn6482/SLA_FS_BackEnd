1️ Promise.withResolvers()

    Promise.withResolvers() creates a promise and gives us its resolve and reject functions separately, so we can control the promise from outside.

2️ Old Promise vs ES2024

    Old way: we create a promise and define resolve inside the constructor.

    ES2024 way: Promise.withResolvers() gives the promise and resolve function directly, making the code cleaner.

3️ Where manual promise control is useful

    Manual promise control is useful when a promise should finish only after an external event like a button click or API response.

4️ Why ES2024 focuses on stability

    ES2024 focuses on stability to make JavaScript safer, faster, and more reliable without breaking old code.
