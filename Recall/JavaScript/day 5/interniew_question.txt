1️ What is closure? Give a real-life use case

    A closure is when a function remembers variables from its outer function even after the outer function is finished.
    
    Use case: Data hiding (like keeping a counter private).

2️ What happens if we don’t use break in switch?

    Without break, execution continues to the next case (called fall-through).

3️ Difference between null and undefined

    undefined: Variable is declared but not assigned

    null: Variable is intentionally empty

4️ What is prototype in JavaScript?

    A prototype allows objects to share methods and properties to save memory.

5️ Why was ES6 introduced?

    ES6 was introduced to make JavaScript cleaner, modern, and easier to write.

6️ Difference between ES5 and ES6

    ES5 uses var and functions, ES6 adds let, const, arrow functions, classes, and modules.

7️ Explain block scope with example

    Variables declared with let and const work only inside { }.

    example

        if (true) {
            let x = 10;
        }

    x is not accessible outside.

8️ What is arrow function? Difference from normal function

    Arrow functions are shorter and do not have their own this.

9️ Why arrow functions don’t have their own this?

    They use this from the surrounding scope to avoid confusion.

10 What are template literals and why used?

    Template literals use backticks ` and allow variables inside strings.

    example
    
    `Hello ${name}`

1️1️ What is destructuring?

    Destructuring extracts values from arrays or objects easily.

    example

    Array:

    let [a, b] = [1, 2];

    Object:

    let { name } = user;

1️2️ Convert ES5 function to ES6

    ES5

        function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }

    ES6

        const add = (a, b) => a + b;

1️3️ Swap two numbers without third variable

    a = a + b;
    b = a - b;
    a = a - b;

1️4️ Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript

    Synchronous: Runs line by line

    Asynchronous: Doesn’t block execution (API, setTimeout)

1️5️ What is a Promise?

    A Promise represents a value that will be available in the future.

1️6️ Promise states

    Pending – initial

    Fulfilled – success

    Rejected – failure

1️7️ Callback vs Promise

    Callback: Nested and hard to manage

    Promise: Cleaner and easier error handling

1️8 What is async/await?

    async/await makes asynchronous code look like synchronous code.

1️9️ Why async/await is better than .then()?

    It improves readability and avoids callback chaining.

2️0️ What happens if promise rejection is not handled?

    It causes errors and may crash the application.

2️1️ What is optional chaining (?.)?

    It prevents errors when accessing nested objects.

    example

    user?.address?.city

2️2️ What is nullish coalescing (??)?

    It returns a default value only if the value is null or undefined.

2️3️ Difference between || and ??

    || checks falsy values

    ?? checks only null and undefined

2️4️ What is event loop?

    The event loop manages async tasks and moves them to the call stack.

2️5️ Microtask queue vs callback queue

    Microtask: Promises

    Callback: setTimeout, setInterval
    
    Microtasks run first.

2️6️ What is setTimeout? Is it async?

    setTimeout runs code after a delay and yes, it is asynchronous.
