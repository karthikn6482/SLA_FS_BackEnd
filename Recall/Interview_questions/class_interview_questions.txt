Class component interview questions (5)

1)What is a class component in React, and how is it different from a functional component??

A class component is a JavaScript class that extends the React class. Component must have a render() method.

Example:

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
  }
}

| Class Component        | Functional Component      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Uses ES6 class         | Uses JavaScript functions |
| Uses lifecycle methods | Uses Hooks                |
| Has `this` keyword     | No `this`                 |
| Uses `setState()`      | Uses `useState()`         |
| More complex           | Simpler and cleaner       |



2)Explain the different lifecycle methods of a React class component and common use cases for each.?

Lifecycle methods are special methods that run at different stages of a component.

Mounting Phase

constructor() ? Initialize state

componentDidMount() ? API calls, timers, subscriptions

Updating Phase

shouldComponentUpdate() ? Performance optimization

componentDidUpdate() ? React to prop/state changes

Unmounting Phase

componentWillUnmount() ? Cleanup (timers, listeners)


3)How does setState work in class components?

setState() updates the component's state.

this.setState({ count: 1 });

Why is it asynchronous?

Improves performance

Batches multiple updates together

Avoids unnecessary re-renders

To access the updated state:

Example:

this.setState({ count: 1 }, () => {
  console.log(this.state.count);
});


4)What is a PureComponent, and how is it different from a regular class component??

PureComponent is like Component, but it does shallow comparison of props and state.

class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {}

| Component         | PureComponent                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Always re-renders | Re-renders only if data changes |
| No comparison     | Shallow comparison              |
| Less optimized    | More optimized                  |


5)How do you implement error boundaries in React, and why do they still require class components??

Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in child components.

They use:

componentDidCatch()

getDerivedStateFromError()

Example:

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  state = { hasError: false };

  static getDerivedStateFromError() {
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    console.log(error);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <h1>Something went wrong</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
