Basic React interview questions (5)

1)What is React, and what problem does it solve compared to traditional DOM manipulation??

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Problems it solves:

Manual DOM manipulation is slow

Hard to manage UI state

Poor performance

React solves these using:

Virtual DOM

Component-based architecture

Efficient updates

2)What is JSX in React, and how is it different from regular HTML??

JSX stands for JavaScript XML.

It looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript.

Example:

const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;

| JSX                         | HTML         |
| --------------------------- | ------------ |
| Uses `className`            | Uses `class` |
| JS expressions allowed `{}` | Not allowed  |
| Must have one parent        | No such rule |

3)What is the difference between props and state in React? Give examples.?

| Props                  | State                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Passed from parent     | Managed by component  |
| Read-only              | Can be changed        |
| Used for communication | Used for dynamic data |

Example:

Props

function Child(props) {
  return <h1>{props.name}</h1>;
}

State

this.state = { count: 0 };

4)What is the virtual DOM, and how does React use it to update the UI efficiently??

Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.

How React uses it:

Creates Virtual DOM

Compares old vs new (diffing)

Updates only changed parts

This makes React fast and efficient.

5)What is a component in React, and what are the main types of 
components?

A component is a reusable piece of UI.

Example:

Button

Header

Footer

Login Form

Types of components:

Functional Components

Class Components
